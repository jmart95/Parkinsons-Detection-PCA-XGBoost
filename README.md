# Parkinsons-Detection-PCA-XGBoost
## Context
Through the used of computer science and medicine, recent discoveries unveil new algorithms to improve health information reporting on clinical decisions. For example, detecting Parkinsonâ€™s Disease through machine learning can bring insight to such decisions. 

## Dataset
* Kaggle Dataset - [Parkinson's Data Set](https://www.kaggle.com/nidaguler/parkinsons-data-set)

## Objective
* Explore the Parkinson's Dataset variance and it's explainability through PCA
* Detect Parkinson's with XGBoost

## Steps
1. Load in Parkinson Dataset
2. Perform EDA with PCA
3. Use MinMaxScaler for reduce label class for -1 to 1
4. Fit and evaluate with XGBoost

## Results
* PCA was used to successfuly preserve the datasets variance by reduce the number of columns to 2 or 3.
* We used an XGBClassifier for this and made use of the sklearn library to prepare the dataset. This gives us an accuracy of <b> 96.66%</b>
